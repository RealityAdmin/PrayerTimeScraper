# PrayerTimeScraper
Small project to scrape prayer times from a masjid website and hopefully auto send messages at a certain time

## How to set up for yourself:
1. Pull this repo onto the hosting machine
2. Create an .env file with the following values: BOT_EMAIL (the gmail address the program will use), APP_PASS (the app password for the gmail address), and YOUR_EMAIL (your own email to send to)
3. Install any dependencies
4. Run main.py
